        <h1>Ezra's Screenprinting Project</h1>
        <h2>The Idea</h2>
	<p>I knew I wanted to make a design incorporating a clock because analog clock faces are visually interesting and quickly draw the viewers attention. The assignment asked for a message to be conveyed, and I wanted to convince people to not destroy the bathrooms. I was initially planning on using some kind of grid pattern like bathroom tiles, but I decided against it due to the nature of the project. The actual final result had to be a screenprint, and peeling out the sticker for a large grid did not appeal to me at all.</p>
	<h2>The Photo</h2>
	<p>Another requirement of the project was to feature a part of my body in the photo, and I decided to use my arm pointing, both to emphasize the clock element and to act as a shelf for the required text. My teammate Khady took the photo of my arm pointing and I wanted to take a photo of the dangling clock in the bathroom but never got around to it. The photo was taken at f/5.6, ISO 1600, with 1/160 seconds exposure, to maximize the blur on the background so that it would be easier to trim it down in photoshop.</p>

        <h2>Work in Photoshop</h2>
	<p>Once I had the photo I needed, I prepared the Photoshop file. I used a custom size file that would fit horizontally on the box, and thought about making a second design using just the tilted clock to put on the square ends of the box but didn’t realize the idea until it was too late. I imported the photo from my team’s photo google drive folder and got to work simplifying the photo. Since I used such a low focal length to take the photo, my arm was well in focus and the wall behind was not which meant the autmoated remove background feature worked well. I then used a small eraser to clean up the edges and fix some of the rough patches left by the automated feature. Since I needed the entire design to be monochromatic, it was a bit of a struggle to figure out how to get the arm into one color and one color only. The filters weren’t very helpful, because while they removed all of the saturation and vibrant colors, there were still dozens of shades of grey throughout the design. I ended up using the fill bucket tool to cover the entire design in a single color. Once I had the arm painted right, I got to work looking for a good image of the school’s clock model. I sound the right image, and got that into photoshop, again using the fill tool to make it a single color, which I made sure matched the arm by painting it with the sample tool. Next, I started the text. I used the line draw tool to set up a structure for the text to follow and conform to. I chose a font that I liked, and accidentally chose a font that would later work well with screenprinting. The font I used was blocky and had minimal details while still looking professional making it easy to read and even easier to peel out of a vinyl sticker.</p>

	<h2>Preparing for the Print</h2>
	<p>To print, you need 5 things.</p>
	<ol>
  <li>A wooden frame.</li>
  <li>Screenprinting mesh to stretch over the frame.</li>
  <li>A vinyl sticker to iron into the screenprinting mesh.</li>
  <li>Paint to push through the mesh and onto your surface.</li>
  <li>A surface that will absorb the paint and print cleanly.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The wooden frame was the easiest part. We started with long planks that we sawed into the 4 sections of our frames with circular saws. Attaching these 4 sectinos into a frame was hard for one person, but quick work for two. Me and my group worked together and got glue in all the corners and held them together using staples form the staple gun. Stretching the printing mesh over the frame was the hardest part of the project for me. Getting rid of slack and holding the mesh stretched while a friend stapled was difficult enough without having to argue with other groups and teams about who got the few staple guns. Next came cutting out the sticker. I was initially confused about the adobe illustrator process but got help from friends and teammates and got it done. The cutting process was nerve-wracking because it was the first time I took my hands off the controls and had to trust the machine. My first attempt at cutting out my sticker failed and I had to stop the machine to save the sticker. The machine had messed up too much of the sticker for me to use it again, but my friend Ariel had a much smaller print and used my sticker to get his design done which was a nice use of the leftovers. My second attmpt at cutting went well even htough I don't have any photos of it. (A common theme throughout the project.)</p>

	<h2>Print Day</h2>
	<p>Setting up for the print is pretty simple. You need your ready to go frame, a hinge and clamp setup to print with, paint to push through your frame, and a flat surface to print on. The color I decided to use was a dark blue, that reminded me of the bathroom paint scheme that originally inspired my project. I used a mix of 3 parts cyan 1 part yellow to create the color I wanted. I also added a little bit of water to lighten up the color and thin it out some for ease of printing, and then printed onto 2 sheets of paper as well as 1 cardboard box. It wasn’t as much printing as I hoped to get done. </p>

	<h2>21st Century Skills</h2>
	<p>The skill that I used most during the project was definitely collaboration, both when I needed physical help, and when I needed help with digital issues like saving and transferring apps. I helped my group members and they helped me, especially when we all needed to use a single tool like a cutting machine or a saw. We also did well when setting up our shared google drive folder and communicating where photos were and how to user the drive folders were important as well. When we only had one class period for getting of our stickers formatted in illustrator, all of us were at different steps in the process. I was farthest ahead so I went ahead and cut my sticker on the machine. While I was cutting, my teammates helped each other format and polish until the next person was ready to cut, and so I went back to the table to help the next person get their illustrator file working. Collaboration was neccessary throughout the project, and I think the shared stress of the deadlines after deadlines helped me bond with my teammates. While I enjoyed the project, I didn't like having to use the big cameras for taking all of the photos. Having to work up to the bell most days meant I couldnt save the photos I took if I took any at all. Taking photos from phones would be much mopre convinent but I understand that most people would probably just use their phones for whatever instead. </p>
